Use this on a region you currently rent to extend it by the given number of days.<br />

<p><b>How to set up regions for buying and renting:</b><br />
In WorldGuard, set the 'buyable' flag for regions to be sold outright. Non-buyable regions will be considered rentable instead. Then set the 'price' flag -- for buyable regions this is just the price, but for rentable regions this is the per-day cost of renting.</p>
<p>Set the region owner to determine who will recieve the money. For rentable regions, you can leave it blank and set the owner of the parent region instead, that way you can have an &quot;Inn&quot; region owned by the proprietor, parent to all the rooms, and not have to set the owner each time.</p>
<p>But either way you MUST have an owner defined somewhere so the plugin knows who to give the money to. Otherwise it will not allow anyone to buy or rent it. If you really want the money to go to nobody, you can enter a fictitious name.</p>
